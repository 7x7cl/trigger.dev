A warning like this may have brought you here. If it hasn't, you probably **don't** need this!

## Graceful shutdown

The above issue only arises if there are any locked jobs when automatic `graphile-worker` migration is attempted.

To prevent this, please shut your server down _gracefully_. How you do this will depend on your platform. This may involve:

- Sending SIGTERM via the `kill` command
- Using `docker stop` or `docker-compose down`
- Triggering a deployment on your managed platform of choice

### Changing the default timeout

Set the `GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` environment variable to change the default of 60 seconds - values are specified in _milliseconds_. This may be required if you have active jobs that need longer to complete.

## Problems

If you run into any other issues, you may have to temporarily scale down to using only _a single instance_. All other instructions above still apply.
