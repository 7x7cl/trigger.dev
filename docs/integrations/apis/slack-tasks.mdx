```ts example.ts
// Send a Slack message using the io.slack.postMessage function
const response = await io.slack.postMessage("post message", {
  // Specify the target channel by providing its ID
  channel: "< your-channel-id >",
  // Set the text content of the message
  text: "My first Slack message",
});

```
